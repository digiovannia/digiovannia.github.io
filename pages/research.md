I currently focus on problems in multi-agent reinforcement learning, particularly general-sum interactions between autonomous agents. As automated sequential decision making becomes more common and powerful in coming decades, algorithms used by principals with different economic and political objectives will come into contact. Humans historically have faced significant coordination and cooperation problems. To the extent that RL algorithms are optimized for the objectives of different groups, it is imperative to ensure that the collective behavior of these algorithms, following their individual incentives, does not cause costly conflicts. To that end, I'm working on the design of algorithms that can both apply game-theoretic principles to incentivize these agents toward mutually beneficial outcomes, and adequately account for uncertainty with statistical methods.

My previous research includes projects in environmental epidemiology, mathematical ecology, and inverse reinforcement learning (the repo MEIRL on my Github is an implementation of an algorithm in this field).
